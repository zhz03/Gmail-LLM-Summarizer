# Gmail-LLM-Summarizer
An open-source Google Apps Script that uses Gemini LLM to automatically classify and summarize your Gmail inbox. It applies deterministic rules (job sites, applications, academic reviews, etc.) combined with LLM-based classification, then generates a daily digest email with highlights and action items.
